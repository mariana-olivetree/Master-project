# Differential Gene Expression Analysis in Metatranscriptomic Data

## Objective

This project focuses on reviewing and applying statistical approaches for **differential gene expression (DGE) analysis** in metatranscriptomic (MT) data. The main goal is to explore the functionality and performance of different tools, specifically **ZIBSeq** and **DESeq2**, to optimize analysis workflows and manage zero counts effectively in MT datasets.

## Project Description

Metatranscriptomic data often contain a high proportion of zero counts, making differential expression analysis challenging. This project investigates:

- The **ZIBSeq package**, utilizing the **LB test** for DGE analysis.  
- The **DESeq2 workflow** within the **MOSCA framework** for comparison.  
- Data origin and preprocessing based on a previous study and the **Integrative Human Microbiome Project (iHMP)**.  

The comparison between ZIBSeq and DESeq2 highlights the importance of selecting appropriate statistical approaches to handle zero counts in MT data. 

## Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**: Authentic MT datasets were sourced from the iHMP.  
2. **Tool Exploration**: Detailed examination of ZIBSeq functionalities and DESeq2 scripts.  
3. **Differential Expression Analysis**: Executed DGE analyses using both approaches.  
4. **Comparison and Evaluation**: Assessed the performance, advantages, and limitations of each tool.
